A) The directed acyclic graphs to visualise the concepts underlying models 1 and 2 were not created using any programming language and henceforth, are not listed here.
B) The visualisation of the bivariate latent change score models is created at the end of the script calculating them using the object returned by lavaan itself.
C) The histogramm of the Bayes Factors of our null-effect simulation analysis is created in the simulation's evaluation script. 
D) Almost all tables are created within tables.Rmd
E)
We manually revised the images to produce the figures found in our manuscript.
In order to condensate the information for our readers, we added two of the original images as produced by the python code for each figure.
We also adapted the colourbars for unstandardized betas to make them only depict values that were actually in the data (nilearn automatically produces colourbars that are symmetrical around 0 for such figures).
Furthermore, we cropped the F-value colourbars to remove the non-significant F-values (originally shown in monotonous grey) and let the colourbars represent the significant F-values more clearly.
