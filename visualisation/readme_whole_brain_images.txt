We manually revised the images to produce the figures found in our manuscript.
In order to condensate the information for our readers, we added two of the original images as produced by the python code for each figure.
We also adapted the colourbars for unstandardized betas to make them only depict values that were actually in the data (nilearn automatically produces colourbars that are symmetrical around 0 for such figures).
Furthermore, we cropped the F-value colourbars to remove the non-significant F-values (originally shown in monotonous grey) and let the colourbars represent the significant F-values more clearly.
